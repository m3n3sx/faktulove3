# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The FaktuLove application is experiencing critical frontend issues where static files (CSS, JavaScript libraries) are not loading properly, causing broken functionality across the entire application. This includes missing icons, non-functional buttons, broken OCR authentication, unstyled admin panel, and failed analytics cards. The errors indicate that essential frontend dependencies like jQuery, Bootstrap, ApexCharts, DataTables, and other libraries are returning 404 errors.

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating FaktuLove2's OCR system from Google Cloud Document AI to an open-source solution. The current system relies heavily on Google Cloud services for document processing, which creates vendor lock-in and ongoing costs. The migration aims to replace this with a self-hosted, open-source OCR solution while maintaining or improving current functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Google Cloud Dependency Removal

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to eliminate all Google Cloud dependencies so that the system can run completely independently without external cloud services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes a document THEN it SHALL NOT make any calls to Google Cloud Document AI APIs
2. WHEN the system starts up THEN it SHALL NOT require Google Cloud credentials or configuration
3. WHEN processing invoices THEN the system SHALL use only local or self-hosted OCR services
4. IF Google Cloud services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue to function normally
5. WHEN migrating existing data THEN all Google Cloud references SHALL be removed or replaced

### Requirement 2: Open Source OCR Engine Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate a powerful open-source OCR engine so that we can process documents with comparable accuracy to Google Cloud Document AI.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting an OCR engine THEN it SHALL be fully open-source with permissive licensing
2. WHEN processing Polish invoices THEN the OCR accuracy SHALL be at least 85% for structured data extraction
3. WHEN processing documents THEN the system SHALL support PDF, JPEG, PNG, and TIFF formats
4. WHEN extracting data THEN the system SHALL identify invoice numbers, dates, amounts, VAT numbers, and company names
5. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages and fallback options

### Requirement 3: Maintain Current API Compatibility

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want the OCR API endpoints to remain unchanged so that existing client applications continue to work without modifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling existing OCR endpoints THEN they SHALL return the same response format as before
2. WHEN uploading documents THEN the API SHALL accept the same file types and parameters
3. WHEN checking processing status THEN the response structure SHALL remain identical
4. WHEN retrieving OCR results THEN the data format SHALL be compatible with existing code
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the error codes and messages SHALL follow the same patterns

### Requirement 4: Performance Equivalence or Improvement

**User Story:** As an end user, I want document processing to be as fast or faster than the current Google Cloud solution so that my workflow is not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a typical invoice THEN it SHALL complete within 30 seconds
2. WHEN processing multiple documents THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent requests efficiently
3. WHEN the system is under load THEN response times SHALL not degrade significantly
4. WHEN comparing to Google Cloud THEN processing accuracy SHALL be within 5% of current performance
5. WHEN monitoring system resources THEN CPU and memory usage SHALL be reasonable for the server capacity

### Requirement 5: Polish Language and Invoice Format Support

**User Story:** As a Polish business user, I want the OCR system to accurately recognize Polish invoice formats and language-specific elements so that my invoices are processed correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing Polish invoices THEN the system SHALL recognize Polish VAT numbers (NIP format)
2. WHEN extracting dates THEN it SHALL handle Polish date formats (DD.MM.YYYY, DD-MM-YYYY)
3. WHEN processing amounts THEN it SHALL recognize Polish currency notation (comma as decimal separator)
4. WHEN identifying companies THEN it SHALL recognize Polish business entity types (Sp. z o.o., S.A., etc.)
5. WHEN extracting text THEN it SHALL handle Polish diacritical marks correctly (ą, ć, ę, ł, ń, ó, ś, ź, ż)

### Requirement 6: Data Migration and Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to migrate existing OCR data seamlessly so that historical processing results remain accessible and functional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating existing data THEN all OCRResult records SHALL be preserved
2. WHEN accessing historical results THEN they SHALL display correctly in the new system
3. WHEN referencing old processing metadata THEN it SHALL be mapped to new format equivalents
4. WHEN running the migration THEN no data SHALL be lost or corrupted
5. WHEN the migration completes THEN all existing Faktura-OCR relationships SHALL remain intact

### Requirement 7: Self-Hosted Infrastructure Requirements

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want clear infrastructure requirements and deployment procedures so that I can set up the new OCR system reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the system THEN it SHALL run on standard Linux servers without special hardware
2. WHEN configuring the system THEN all dependencies SHALL be installable via standard package managers
3. WHEN scaling the system THEN it SHALL support horizontal scaling for increased throughput
4. WHEN monitoring the system THEN it SHALL provide health checks and performance metrics
5. WHEN backing up the system THEN all OCR models and configuration SHALL be included

### Requirement 8: Security and Privacy Compliance

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want the OCR system to maintain the same security standards as the current system so that sensitive business documents remain protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing documents THEN all data SHALL remain on-premises or in controlled environments
2. WHEN storing temporary files THEN they SHALL be encrypted and automatically cleaned up
3. WHEN accessing OCR services THEN authentication and authorization SHALL be enforced
4. WHEN logging operations THEN sensitive document content SHALL NOT be logged
5. WHEN handling errors THEN document content SHALL NOT be exposed in error messages

### Requirement 9: Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring of the OCR system so that I can detect and resolve issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL provide health status endpoints
2. WHEN processing documents THEN metrics SHALL be collected for processing time and accuracy
3. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient detail for troubleshooting
4. WHEN performance degrades THEN alerts SHALL be triggered automatically
5. WHEN analyzing usage THEN statistics SHALL be available for capacity planning

### Requirement 10: Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want comprehensive testing capabilities so that I can verify the OCR system works correctly across different document types and scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN there SHALL be a comprehensive test suite covering all OCR functionality
2. WHEN testing accuracy THEN there SHALL be benchmark datasets for Polish invoices
3. WHEN validating performance THEN there SHALL be load testing capabilities
4. WHEN comparing results THEN there SHALL be tools to measure accuracy against known good data
5. WHEN deploying changes THEN automated tests SHALL verify system functionality

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The FaktuLove system needs a comprehensive RESTful API layer for OCR document processing to support the React frontend. The API should provide secure, efficient endpoints for document upload, processing status tracking, result retrieval, and manual validation. The system must handle asynchronous processing with Celery, implement proper authentication and rate limiting, and provide consistent JSON responses with comprehensive error handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a React frontend developer, I want to upload documents for OCR processing via API, so that users can submit invoices and receipts for automated data extraction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to `/api/ocr/upload/` THEN the system SHALL accept PDF, JPG, and PNG files
2. WHEN file validation occurs THEN the system SHALL reject files larger than 10MB
3. WHEN file validation occurs THEN the system SHALL validate MIME types for security
4. WHEN upload is successful THEN the system SHALL return a unique task_id for tracking
5. WHEN user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL return 401 Unauthorized
6. WHEN CSRF token is missing THEN the system SHALL return 403 Forbidden
7. WHEN upload succeeds THEN the system SHALL queue the document for async OCR processing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a React frontend user, I want to track the processing status of my uploaded documents, so that I know when OCR processing is complete and results are available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is made to `/api/ocr/status/<task_id>/` THEN the system SHALL return current processing status
2. WHEN status is requested THEN the system SHALL return one of: 'pending', 'processing', 'completed', 'failed'
3. WHEN processing is in progress THEN the system SHALL return progress percentage if available
4. WHEN processing time can be estimated THEN the system SHALL return ETA
5. WHEN task_id is invalid THEN the system SHALL return 404 Not Found
6. WHEN user doesn't own the task THEN the system SHALL return 403 Forbidden

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a React frontend user, I want to retrieve my OCR processing results, so that I can review extracted invoice data and manage my documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is made to `/api/ocr/results/` THEN the system SHALL return paginated list of user's OCR results
2. WHEN results are requested THEN the system SHALL support filtering by date range
3. WHEN results are requested THEN the system SHALL support filtering by confidence score
4. WHEN results are requested THEN the system SHALL support filtering by processing status
5. WHEN pagination is applied THEN the system SHALL return 20 results per page by default
6. WHEN results are returned THEN the system SHALL include metadata: total count, page info, filters applied

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a React frontend user, I want to view detailed OCR results for a specific document, so that I can see extracted fields with confidence scores and access generated invoices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is made to `/api/ocr/result/<result_id>/` THEN the system SHALL return detailed OCR result
2. WHEN detailed result is returned THEN the system SHALL include all extracted fields with confidence scores
3. WHEN a Faktura was generated THEN the system SHALL include link to the generated invoice
4. WHEN confidence scores are low THEN the system SHALL highlight fields requiring manual review
5. WHEN result_id is invalid THEN the system SHALL return 404 Not Found
6. WHEN user doesn't own the result THEN the system SHALL return 403 Forbidden

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a React frontend user, I want to validate and correct OCR results, so that I can ensure accuracy of extracted data before creating invoices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to `/api/ocr/validate/<result_id>/` THEN the system SHALL accept manual corrections
2. WHEN corrections are submitted THEN the system SHALL update the OCR result with corrected data
3. WHEN corrections are applied THEN the system SHALL update confidence scores based on validation
4. WHEN validation is complete THEN the system SHALL trigger invoice generation if applicable
5. WHEN validation data is invalid THEN the system SHALL return 400 Bad Request with field errors
6. WHEN user doesn't own the result THEN the system SHALL return 403 Forbidden

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper error handling and security measures, so that the API is secure, reliable, and provides clear feedback for troubleshooting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes (4xx/5xx)
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return consistent JSON error format
3. WHEN rate limiting is exceeded THEN the system SHALL return 429 Too Many Requests
4. WHEN rate limiting applies THEN the system SHALL limit uploads to 10 per minute per user
5. WHEN API operations occur THEN the system SHALL log all requests and responses
6. WHEN sensitive data is logged THEN the system SHALL exclude personal information from logs

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the API, I want consistent response formats and comprehensive documentation, so that I can reliably build frontend features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API responses are returned THEN the system SHALL use consistent JSON structure
2. WHEN successful responses are returned THEN the system SHALL include 'success': true and 'data' fields
3. WHEN error responses are returned THEN the system SHALL include 'success': false and 'error' fields
4. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL return field-specific error messages
5. WHEN API endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL include proper CORS headers for React frontend
6. WHEN API documentation is needed THEN the system SHALL provide OpenAPI/Swagger documentation

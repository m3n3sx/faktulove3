# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The OCR integration system has been implemented with automatic document processing, but users are experiencing an issue where the interface continues to show "Oczekuje na przetwarzanie" (Waiting for processing) status even after OCR processing should have completed. This feature aims to fix the status synchronization between the OCR processing pipeline and the user interface to provide accurate real-time feedback to users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user uploading a document for OCR processing, I want to see accurate real-time status updates, so that I know when my document has been processed and can access the results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document is uploaded for OCR processing THEN the system SHALL display "Oczekuje na przetwarzanie" status initially
2. WHEN OCR processing begins THEN the system SHALL update the status to "Przetwarzanie w toku" (Processing in progress)
3. WHEN OCR processing completes successfully THEN the system SHALL update the status to "Przetworzono" (Processed)
4. WHEN OCR processing fails THEN the system SHALL update the status to "Błąd przetwarzania" (Processing error)
5. WHEN the status changes THEN the user interface SHALL reflect the new status without requiring a page refresh

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the OCR results immediately after processing completes, so that I can review and use the extracted data without delay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OCR processing completes successfully THEN the system SHALL automatically display the extracted data
2. WHEN confidence threshold is met THEN the system SHALL automatically create a Faktura record
3. WHEN confidence threshold is not met THEN the system SHALL display the OCR results for manual review
4. WHEN OCR results are displayed THEN the user SHALL be able to edit and correct any extracted data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want reliable status tracking and error handling, so that I can monitor OCR processing performance and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OCR processing encounters an error THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN processing status changes THEN the system SHALL persist the status in the database
3. WHEN a processing task fails THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
4. WHEN multiple retry attempts fail THEN the system SHALL mark the document as failed and notify administrators

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper signal handling and task coordination, so that the OCR processing pipeline works reliably across different deployment environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an OCRResult is created THEN the system SHALL trigger processing via Django signals
2. WHEN Celery tasks are executed THEN the system SHALL update database status atomically
3. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL send real-time updates to the frontend
4. WHEN the system is deployed THEN the OCR pipeline SHALL work consistently in both development and production environments

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements PaddleOCR as the primary OCR engine for the FaktuLove Polish invoice management system. PaddleOCR will replace the current OCR engines to achieve 95% accuracy target specifically for Polish invoices, with specialized preprocessing, pattern recognition, and confidence scoring algorithms. The implementation will integrate seamlessly with the existing Django OCR infrastructure while providing superior performance for Polish document processing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Polish business owner, I want the system to accurately extract invoice data from scanned documents using PaddleOCR, so that I can digitize my invoices with minimal manual corrections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a Polish invoice document THEN the system SHALL process it using PaddleOCR as the primary engine
2. WHEN PaddleOCR processes a Polish invoice THEN the system SHALL achieve >90% accuracy on standard Polish invoice fields
3. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL return extracted data within 2 seconds per invoice
4. IF PaddleOCR fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to existing OCR engines automatically

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want PaddleOCR to be properly configured with Polish language support, so that it can recognize Polish text patterns and characters accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN PaddleOCR SHALL load with Polish language models
2. WHEN PaddleOCR processes text THEN it SHALL recognize Polish diacritical marks (ą, ć, ę, ł, ń, ó, ś, ź, ż)
3. WHEN the service starts THEN it SHALL validate Polish language model availability
4. IF Polish models are missing THEN the system SHALL log appropriate error messages and use fallback configuration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want advanced image preprocessing specifically optimized for Polish invoices, so that PaddleOCR can achieve maximum accuracy on various document qualities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image is processed THEN the system SHALL apply Polish-specific preprocessing algorithms
2. WHEN preprocessing occurs THEN the system SHALL enhance contrast, remove noise, and correct skew
3. WHEN dealing with low-quality scans THEN the system SHALL apply adaptive enhancement techniques
4. WHEN preprocessing completes THEN the enhanced image SHALL be optimized for Polish text recognition

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Polish accountant, I want the system to extract specific Polish invoice fields (NIP, REGON, KRS, VAT rates), so that all required business information is captured accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing Polish invoices THEN the system SHALL extract NIP numbers with validation
2. WHEN extracting company data THEN the system SHALL identify REGON and KRS numbers
3. WHEN processing VAT information THEN the system SHALL recognize Polish VAT rates (0%, 5%, 8%, 23%)
4. WHEN extracting dates THEN the system SHALL handle Polish date formats (DD.MM.YYYY, DD-MM-YYYY)
5. WHEN processing amounts THEN the system SHALL handle Polish decimal separators (comma and period)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance specialist, I want the system to provide confidence scores for extracted data, so that I can identify fields that may need manual verification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PaddleOCR extracts data THEN the system SHALL calculate confidence scores for each field
2. WHEN confidence is below 80% THEN the system SHALL flag the field for manual review
3. WHEN multiple extraction attempts occur THEN the system SHALL use the highest confidence result
4. WHEN confidence scoring completes THEN the system SHALL store scores in the database for audit purposes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want robust error handling and fallback mechanisms, so that the OCR service remains available even when PaddleOCR encounters issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PaddleOCR fails to initialize THEN the system SHALL fallback to Tesseract/EasyOCR
2. WHEN processing times exceed 5 seconds THEN the system SHALL timeout and use fallback engines
3. WHEN memory usage exceeds 800MB THEN the system SHALL optimize processing or restart the service
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
5. IF fallback engines are used THEN the system SHALL notify administrators of the degraded service

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want the PaddleOCR service to meet strict performance requirements, so that the system can handle production workloads efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing invoices THEN the system SHALL complete processing within 2 seconds per document
2. WHEN multiple requests are processed THEN memory usage SHALL not exceed 800MB per process
3. WHEN the service runs continuously THEN it SHALL maintain stable performance without memory leaks
4. WHEN load testing occurs THEN the system SHALL handle at least 10 concurrent requests

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want proper NIP validation with checksum verification, so that extracted Polish tax identification numbers are verified for accuracy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a NIP number is extracted THEN the system SHALL validate its format (10 digits)
2. WHEN NIP validation occurs THEN the system SHALL verify the checksum algorithm
3. WHEN invalid NIPs are detected THEN the system SHALL flag them for manual review
4. WHEN validation completes THEN the system SHALL store validation results with confidence scores

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive unit tests and documentation, so that the PaddleOCR implementation is maintainable and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the implementation is complete THEN unit tests SHALL cover >90% of the codebase
2. WHEN tests run THEN they SHALL validate all major functionality including error scenarios
3. WHEN documentation is created THEN it SHALL include integration guide and performance benchmarks
4. WHEN Polish patterns are configured THEN they SHALL be documented with examples

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want seamless integration with the existing Django OCR infrastructure, so that PaddleOCR works with current workflows and APIs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PaddleOCR is implemented THEN it SHALL integrate with existing OCR service factory
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN existing endpoints SHALL work without modification
3. WHEN database operations occur THEN current OCR result models SHALL be used
4. WHEN the service is deployed THEN it SHALL work with existing Docker and deployment configurations

## ðŸš€ New Files Created

### JavaScript Modules
- `static/assets/js/static-file-monitor.js` - Monitors missing static files
- `static/assets/js/error-tracking.js` - Comprehensive error tracking system
- `static/assets/js/performance-optimizer.js` - Performance optimization and monitoring

### Test Scripts
- `test_invoice_workflow.py` - End-to-end invoice creation testing
- `test_ocr_upload_workflow.py` - OCR upload functionality testing
- `run_all_tests.py` - Comprehensive test runner
- `scripts/production_deployment_checklist.py` - Production readiness validation

### Enhanced Functionality
- Updated `static/assets/js/invoice-form-manager.js` with better error handling
- Enhanced `faktury/templates/base.html` with monitoring scripts

## ðŸ”§ Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. Error Handling & Monitoring
- **Safe Error Handler**: Prevents infinite loops and provides basic error handling
- **Static File Monitor**: Tracks and reports missing static files with 404 detection
- **Error Tracking**: Comprehensive JavaScript error tracking with performance monitoring
- **Performance Optimizer**: Resource prioritization, lazy loading, and Core Web Vitals monitoring

### 2. Invoice Management
- **Enhanced Form Manager**: Improved JavaScript handling with proper error boundaries
- **"Dodaj" Button Fix**: Ensures proper navigation to invoice creation form
- **Form Validation**: Comprehensive client-side and server-side validation
- **User Feedback**: Clear success/error messages and progress indicators

### 3. OCR Upload System
- **React Upload Component**: Functional file upload with drag-and-drop
- **Fallback Form**: Server-side fallback when JavaScript is disabled
- **Progress Tracking**: Upload progress and completion feedback
- **Error Recovery**: Proper error handling and user notifications

### 4. Navigation & Icons
- **RemixIcon Integration**: Proper font loading and fallback mechanisms
- **Icon Fallbacks**: Text-based fallbacks for critical navigation
- **Loading Detection**: Icon loading error detection and recovery

### 5. Performance & Production Readiness
- **Resource Optimization**: Critical resource prioritization and lazy loading
- **Caching Strategy**: LocalStorage caching for small resources
- **Compression Detection**: Automatic gzip/brotli compression detection
- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive system health checks

## ðŸ§ª Testing Framework

### Automated Tests
1. **Invoice Workflow Test** (`test_invoice_workflow.py`)
   - Tests "Dodaj" button navigation
   - Validates form submission process
   - Confirms invoice appears in list

2. **OCR Upload Test** (`test_ocr_upload_workflow.py`)
   - Verifies upload page loads without loading messages
   - Tests file selection and upload process
   - Validates progress feedback

3. **Production Checklist** (`scripts/production_deployment_checklist.py`)
   - Validates all critical fixes
   - Checks static files and React bundles
   - Verifies error handling implementation
   - Confirms production readiness

### Test Execution
```bash
# Run all tests
./run_all_tests.py

# Run individual tests
./test_invoice_workflow.py
./test_ocr_upload_workflow.py
./scripts/production_deployment_checklist.py
```

## ðŸ“Š System Health Monitoring

### Real-time Monitoring
- **JavaScript Error Tracking**: Global error handlers with rate limiting
- **Static File Monitoring**: 404 detection and reporting
- **Performance Metrics**: Core Web Vitals and resource timing
- **Health Check Endpoints**: System status validation

### Dashboard Access
```javascript
// Access error dashboard
window.getErrorDashboard()

// Check static file status
window.staticFileHealthCheck()

// Get performance report
window.PerformanceOptimizer.getPerformanceReport()
```

## ðŸ”’ Production Security

### Security Measures Implemented
- **CSRF Protection**: All forms include CSRF tokens
- **Input Validation**: Client and server-side validation
- **Error Sanitization**: Safe error messages without sensitive data
- **Rate Limiting**: Error reporting and API calls rate limited

### Configuration Validation
- Django settings validation for production
- Environment variables checking
- Database migration status verification
- Dependency compatibility validation

## ðŸš€ Deployment Instructions

### Pre-deployment Checklist
